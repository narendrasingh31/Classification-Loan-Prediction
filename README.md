# Classification-Loan-Prediction
This Repository contains the Loan Prediction Project created by using 5 different Machine Learning Algorithms.


**Classification Algorithms used:**
1. Logistic Regression (LR)
2. Super Vector Machine (SVM)
3. Decision Tree 
4. K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
5. Random Forest (RF)

## Problem Estatement:
Company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer detail provided while filling online application form.

## Overview:
In this project, we are going to predict the Loan Status of customers fro home loan using various information of customers Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others.

## Comparison of Loan Status with Education type:

## Data Dictionary:
Variable - Description

Loan_ID - Unique Loan ID

Gender - Male/ Female

Married - Applicant married (Y/N)

Dependents - Number of dependents (0,1,2,3+)

Education - Applicant Education (Graduate/ Under Graduate)

Self_Employed - Self employed (Y/N)

ApplicantIncome - Applicant income

CoapplicantIncome - Coapplicant income

LoanAmount - Loan amount in thousands

Loan_Amount_Term - Term of loan in months

Credit_History - Credit history meets guidelines

Property_Area - Urban/ Semi Urban/ Rural

Loan_Status - Loan approved (Y/N)

This dataset can be obtained in the following challenge: https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-loan-prediction-iii/


## Conclusion:
In this project, we tried to build a model using ML algorithms,and the k-Nearest Neighbour is the the best possible prediction to get the Loan status.
